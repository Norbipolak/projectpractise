						review: "One Hundred Years of Solitude is the history of the isolated town of Macondo and of the family who founds it, the Buendías. For years, the town has no contact with the outside world, except for gypsies who occasionally visit, peddling technologies like ice and telescopes.",

						author: "J. R. R. Tolkien",

						review: "The culmination of the famous Lord of the Rings trilogy, this book concludes the epic journey our heroes have embarked upon at the start of the story. It is emotional, exciting and  the ending perfectly satisfies any expectation one would have. The concepts of heroism, positive masculinity, companionship and the importance of little things' impact in opposition of evil are all present, but my favorite part is the very end, which showcases the aftermath of war and the toll it takes on the people.",

The story tackles interesting topics, such as personal growth through hardships, the importance of company and the horrors of war. The world building, unique creatures and the author's descriptive style makes this 'children's book' one of my favorites.",

						genres: ["Action", "Adventure", "Fantasy", "Sci-Fi"],
						review: "The ending episode of the prequel trilogy of the beloved Star Wars series, which is one of the most influential works in the history of cinema and sci-fi. The emotional impact of this movie for me is almost unmeasurable, the characters go through the hardest struggles of their lives, while the world reshapes around them. The fall from grace topic always had me interested, and seeing the literal and figurative births of characters from the original trilogy is always a highly emotional part. Accompanied by the beautiful score of John Williams, this movie will always be the closest to my heart.",

						genres: ["Action", "Crime", "Drama", "Music"],
						review: "Dynamic, musical and exciting, this movie combines elements from heist movies, musicals and racing movies. We follow the extremely talented driver, nicknamed Baby, who has to work for a criminal mastermind after accidentally crossing paths with him, paying back his debts in the form of being the getaway driver of his crew of bank robbers. The main character suffers from tinnitus, and copes with it in the form of constantly listening to music, making every scene full of life and energy. The direction might be my favorite part, it builds around the songs extremely well, always stringing us along with the vibes."

						stars: ["Elijah Wood", "Viggo Mortensen", "Ian McKellen"],
						genres: ["Action", "Adventure", "Drama", "Fantasy"],
						review: "The epic conclusion to the legendary Lord of the Rings series, this production stands as one of the most awarded movies of all time. From start to finish, this story does not fail to capture the audience and elicit an emotional response. From the high-scale battle of Pelennor Fields, to the small-scale struggle of Frodo and Sam, the movie excels in all aspects, perfectly adapting Tolkien's story to the big screen. The extreme runtime might be a deterrent to some, but the true experience the director's cut provides is unmatched on a cinematic scale, especially with the beautiful music composed by Howard Shore.",

						writers: ["Michael Crichton", "David Koepp"],
						stars: ["Sam Neill", "Laura Dern", "Jeff Goldblum"],
						genres: ["Action", "Adventure", "Sci-Fi", "Thriller"],
						review: "One of the most ambitious projects of the 1980s, this movie captured their audience with ground-breaking technology, blowing away every viewer with its massive scale dinosaur animatronics. The almost horror-like story, which tackles the perversion of science and greed of mankind, is highlighted by the bone-chilling atmosphere the huge reptiles provide with their earthquake-like stomps and blood-curdling growls. The music and sound design elevate this movie above the rest, while the dinosaurs pull in everyone's attention."

There -- surrounded by banks of the most sophisticated computer-assisted equipment, and sealed off from the outside world except for a telecommunications link with the national security apparatus -- they work against the threat of a worldwide epidemic to find an antidote to the unknown microorganism that has inexplicably killed all but two inhabitants (an elderly derelict and an infant) of the tiny Arizona town where the satellite was retrieved. Step by step they begin to unravel the puzzle of the Andromeda Strain, until, terrifyingly, their microbacterial adversary ruptures the hypersterile seal of the laboratory and their already desperate search for a biomedical answer becomes a split-second race against an atomic deadline.",

But his contentment is disturbed when the wizard Gandalf and a company of dwarves arrive on his doorstep one day to whisk him away on an adventure.

							review: "Yellowstone follows the Dutton family, led by John Dutton, who controls the largest contiguous ranch in the United States, under constant attack by those it borders - land developers, an Indian reservation, and America's first National Park. It is an intense study of a violent world far from media scrutiny - where land grabs make developers billions, and politicians are bought and sold by the world's largest oil and lumber corporations. Where drinking water poisoned by fracking wells and unsolved murders are not news: they are a consequence of living in the new frontier. It is the best and worst of America seen through the eyes of a family that represents both",
